# Current Implementations:

### Wav Player

A simple .wav player that can receive a Filepath Directory (by text or by dragging folders from an Explorer window), populating a list of playable audio files.

Has 'PlayAll' functionality; able to play sequential files starting at either an index of 0 (start of list) or currentIndex+1 (the next file from the file currently selected).

--- for future:

Implement functionality to inherit a spreadsheet (either Excel, Google Sheet or .csv) and assign English text to each file in a second column.
